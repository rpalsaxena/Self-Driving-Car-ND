Brief overview of the state of open source hardware (silicon), worth a look if we want to leverage some of it: https://speakerdeck.com/wallento/the-state-of-open-source-processors-and-open-source-silicon Shared by @georgesung

Tensorflow-XLA rollout. It has some significance for embedded, I believe. https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/experimental/xla/
